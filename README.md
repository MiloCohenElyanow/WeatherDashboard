# WeatherDashboard

## Description
-This web app is a fully functional weather dashboard that will show you the weather for any area in the united states for the current day and the next five days. This entire
project is powered by the Open Weather Api which you can check out [Here](https://openweathermap.org/api). Most of the styling was done with bootstrap which you can find [Here](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Why?
-This web application was meant to challenge my knowledge of Javascript and how to build a dynamic website that features a web Api. From how well this application
function I feel I have demonstrated a good knowledge of how to use Apis and more so how to use Javascript to utilize Api's. This web app is also a good alternative 
to find reliable weather information for wherever you need.
